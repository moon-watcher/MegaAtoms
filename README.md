# About

Atoms is 6 player multi-player game in which you have to create take control of the playing board.
you can play it in hot seat mode against 5 other people, or against (quite stupid) AI players.

# How To Play

Place your atoms on any empty square or stack them on top of your own, but when the numbers get too high they will go critical! When it explodes it will send atoms flying and end up stacking on the atoms around it, which not long increases the size of the stack but also put the stack under your control.  This is the key to taking over the gaming board.
